cd DiscountMart


Install Dependencies:
npm install

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Required packages include express, ejs, and others listed in package.json.

Set Up Environment:

Create a .env file for sensitive data (e.g., MongoDB URI, session secrets) if applicable.
Example .env:PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/discountmart




Run MongoDB:

Ensure MongoDB is running locally or provide a cloud-based MongoDB URI.
Start MongoDB: mongod

Usage

Homepage: Browse discounted grocery items and use the search bar to find specific products.

Contact Us: Submit inquiries via the contact form or view support contact details.

Development Notes

Styling: All pages use inline CSS with consistent fonts (Jost for body text, Playfair Display for headings) and a color scheme defined by CSS variables (--primary, --secondary, --text, etc.).
JavaScript:
login.js: Handles password visibility toggling and form validation.
signup.js: Formats phone numbers, validates forms, and adds visual feedback for required fields.
contact-us.js: Validates contact form submissions with email regex checks.
faq.js: Implements accordion functionality for FAQs, toggling answers on click.


EJS Templates: Pages are modularized with header.ejs and footer.ejs for consistent navigation and footer content.
Error Handling: Ensure index.js includes proper middleware for CSRF protection and error handling (e.g., Multer for file uploads, if used).

Debugging Tips

EJS Syntax Errors: If you encounter SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token, use ejs-lint to debug:npm install -g ejs-lint
ejs-lint views/faq.ejs


FAQ Toggle Issues: If the FAQ accordion doesnâ€™t work, check the console for errors, verify the Font Awesome CDN, and ensure .faq-question and .faq-answer elements are rendered correctly.
File Encoding: Save all .ejs files in UTF-8 without BOM to avoid parsing issues.
Server Logs: Check server logs for errors related to routes or MongoDB connections.
